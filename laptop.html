<h2 id="laptop-definition">Laptop Definition</h2>
<p>A <strong>laptop</strong> is a portable personal computer designed for mobile use, with an integrated screen, keyboard, and battery. Unlike desktop computers, laptops are compact and self-contained, allowing users to operate them on the go. The ability to run on battery power makes laptops convenient for working or browsing the internet without the need for a continuous power source. Laptops are widely used in various settings, including offices, schools, and as personal devices for entertainment.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-laptops">Types of Laptops</h2>
<p>There are various types of laptops, each designed with specific purposes in mind. One of the main categories is the <strong>ultrabook</strong>, a thin, lightweight laptop designed for portability and extended battery life. Ultrabooks are ideal for users who prioritize mobility over high-end performance. They typically have solid-state drives (SSDs) for faster data access and are designed to run basic tasks such as web browsing, word processing, and media consumption.</p>
<p>Another type is the <strong>gaming laptop</strong>, built to handle high-performance graphics and processing power. These laptops are equipped with powerful graphics cards, high-refresh-rate screens, and enhanced cooling systems to ensure they can handle demanding tasks like gaming or video editing. Due to their higher performance, gaming laptops tend to be heavier and bulkier than ultrabooks.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are <strong>2-in-1 laptops</strong>, which can function both as a traditional laptop and as a tablet. These versatile devices have touchscreens that can rotate or detach to be used as standalone tablets, making them perfect for users who need the flexibility to switch between laptop and tablet modes. This hybrid design offers convenience and adaptability for various work environments.</p>
<h2 id="laptop-hardware">Laptop Hardware</h2>
<p>Laptop hardware consists of the physical components that make up the device. The <strong>processor (CPU)</strong> is the brain of the laptop, responsible for executing instructions and running programs. Modern laptops feature processors like Intel&#39;s Core i5 or i7, or AMD&#39;s Ryzen series. The <strong>memory (RAM)</strong> is another essential component, providing the laptop with temporary storage to quickly access running applications and data. RAM capacity typically ranges from 4GB to 16GB in most consumer laptops, but high-performance models may offer more.</p>
<p>Key components in laptops include the <strong>hard drive (HDD)</strong> or <strong>solid-state drive (SSD)</strong> for storing data, the <strong>graphics card (GPU)</strong> for handling visual processing, and the <strong>display</strong> for presenting content to the user. Modern laptops often come with LED or OLED displays, which offer bright, high-resolution screens.</p>
